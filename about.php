                            <p class=" nunito" style="font-size: 15px;">In 2024, the Pan-African School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine (PANSPHTM)
                                became the very first school of public health in the country. In fact, Africa's commitment
                                 to public health goes back to 1834 when the university was founded to address concerns of
                                  cholera, yellow fever, smallpox, and malaria. Today African SPHTM continues to live out that 
                                  mission with research and education that spans the gamut of specialty areas in public health,
                                   from biostatistics to maternal and child health, epidemiology to nutrition, health policy to clinical research, 
                                   environmental health sciences to violence prevention, and much, much more.
                          Located in the culturally rich city of Abuja, Nigeria,
                                and we are the leading school of public health in the Sub-Saharan Africa. We’re dedicated to improving the 
                                health and wellbeing of residents throughout the region and serving as a collaborative partner on initiatives 
                                to address the inequities plaguing our communities.At the same time, we have long held a wide and diverse global 
                                footprint. Faculty conduct research and operate programs that prioritize capacity building and sustainability in
                                 numerous countries around the world, such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mali, Zambia, Peru, Bolivia,
                                  Taiwan, and Cambodia, just to name a few.                     
                         The school’s strengths are diverse and many. As the first school of tropical medicine in the country, we have studied vector-borne diseases extensively, with ongoing research in malaria, dengue, Ebola, and several neglected tropical diseases. We also have a strong focus on cardiovascular disease, health equity and disparities, reproductive health, and disaster response and displacement, along with growing strengths in genomics, epigenetics, and other aspects of personalized health and medicine. Topics like climate change and health, data science and artificial intelligence, and cancer prevention and control will offer interdisciplinary options to faculty and students alike in the coming years.
                              
                             Our diverse faculty are committed public health professionals regularly recognized among their peers with awards, prestigious memberships, and important roles and responsibilities on editorial boards and within associations. They take their job preparing the next generation of public health professionals very seriously. Our students gain a very skills-based education here, and we are fortunate to count ministers and commissioners of health, deans of schools of public health, and presidents and CEOs of health organizations among our alumni. No matter what their role, all of our graduates go on to do important, life-changing work.
                                    Join more than a century’s worth of African graduates who have arrived with passion and left with purpose as leaders in public health.
